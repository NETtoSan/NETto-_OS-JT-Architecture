JT Arechitecture is a discord bot for NETSU Labs that supplies functionalities for users.

It can be use for fun!. Or you can completely steal this code without any issues. Dont worry, many people did this to me

## setup

2. Run `npm i` in your terminal
3. Once installed. Head to system/config/bot.json (or something similar). Then enter your bot token in "token" section in JSON file
4. Run `node .` in your terminal. If i wasnt an idiot just spam commits or you did it correctly. Then the bot will run just fine

## Have fun with JT Architecture!
